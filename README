PnMPI is a dynamic MPI tool infrastructure that builds on top of
the standardized PMPI interface. It allows the user to
- run multiple PMPI tools concurrently
- activate PMPI tools without relinking by just changing a
  configuration file
- multiplex toolsets during a single run
- write cooperative PMPI tools

The package contains three main components:
- The PnMPI core infrastructure
- An MPI wrapper generation infrastructure
- Tool modules that can explicitly exploit PnMPI's capabilities

So far, this software has mainly been tested on Linux clusters with
RHEL-based OS distributions as well as IBM's BG/P systems. Additionally
the system ran on IBM AIX systems, but this support has been deprecated.
Some preliminary experiments have also included SGI Altix systems and
Mac OSX 10.6. Ports to other platforms should be straightforward, but
this is not extensively tested. Please contact the author if you run
into problems porting PnMPI or if you successfully deployed PnMPI
on a new platform.

A) Building PnMPI
===============================================================
PnMPI uses CMake for its build system.

A1) Install CMake
-----------------
CMake can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org.
You will need at least version 2.6, and for BG/P systems you
will need version 2.8.3.

A2) Configure the project
-------------------------
In the simplest case, you can run this in the top-level directory
of the PnMPI tree:

   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/destination
   make
   make install

This will configure, build, and install PnMPI to the destination
specified.  PnMPI supports parallel make with the -j parameter.
E.g., for using eight build tasks, use:

   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/destination
   make -j8
   make install

On more complex machines, such as those with filesystems shared among
multiple platforms, you will want to separate out your build directories
for each platform.  CMake makes this easy.

Create a new build directory named according to the platform you
are using, cd into it, an run cmake there.  For example:

  cd <pnmpi>
  mkdir x86_64
  cd x86_64
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/destination ..

Here, '<pnmpi>' is the top-level directory in the PnMPI tree.  Note
that when you run CMake this way, you need to supply the path to the
PnMPI *source* directory as the last parameter.  Here, that's just '..'
as we are building in a subdirectory of the source directory.  Once
you run CMake, simply run make and make install as before:

  make -j8
  make install

The PnMPI build should autdetect your MPI installation and determine
library and header locations.  If you want to build with a
particular MPI that is NOT the one autodetected by the build,
you can supply your particular MPI compiler as a parameter:

  cmake \
    -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/destination \
    -D MPI_C_COMPILER=/path/to/my/mpicc \
    ..

See the documentation in cmakemodules/FindMPI.cmake for more
details on MPI build configuration options.

If you have problems, you may want to build PnMPI in debug mode.  You
can do this by supplying an additional paramter to CMake, e.g.:

  cmake \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/destination \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    ..

The build directory contains a few sample invocations of
cmake that have been successfully used on LLNL systems.


A3) Configuring with/without Fortran
------------------------------------

By default PnMPI is configured to work with C/C++ and
Fortran codes. However, on systems where Fortran is not
available, the system should autodetect this and not
build the Fortran libraries and demo codes. It can also
be manually turned off by adding

    -D ENABLE_FORTRAN=OFF

to the cmake configuration command.

On most systems, the linkage between Fortran calls to
MPI and the PnMPI interception system should work. On
some systems, though, it is necessary to explicitly
specify the name translation between Fortran and C. The
following contains addition to the cmake configuration
command depending on how a Fortran compiler translates
C names:

	Adding "_" to C name:    -DF77SYMBOL=symbol_
	Adding "__" to C name:   -DF77SYMBOL=symbol__
	Not adding a charcacter: -DF77SYMBOL=symbol

The PnMPI distribution contains demo codes for C and
for Fortran that allow you to test the correct
linkage.


A4) Configuring for cross-compiled environments
-----------------------------------------------
When configuring PnMPI in cross-compiled environments (such
as Blue Gene/P systems), it is necessary to provide a
matching tool chain file. Example files that allow the
compilation on certain LC machines can be found in the
cmakemodules directory. For example, to configure PnMPI
for a BG/P machine with settings matching LC's machines
and using the GNU compliler suite, add the following to
the cmake configuration command:

-D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmakemodules/Toolchain/BlueGeneP-gnu.cmake

or likewise, for BG/Q:

-D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmakemodules/Toolchain/BlueGeneQ-gnu.cmake

A5) Installed structure
-----------------------
Once you've installed, All your PnMPI files and executables should
be in <CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>, the path specified during configuration.
Roughly, the install tree looks like this:

bin/
  pnmpi-patch          Library patching utility
  wrap.py              Wrapper generator for making PMPI tools
lib/
  libpnmpi[f].[so,a]   PnMPI runtime libraries
  pnmpi-modules/       System-installed tool modules
  cmake/               Build files for external modules
include/
  pnmpi.h              PnMPI header
  pnmpimod.h           PnMPI module support
  pnmpi-config.h       CMake generated configuration file
share/
  cmake/               CMake files to support tool module builds

Test programs are not installed, but in the 'demo' folder of the
build directory, there should also be test programs built with PnMPI.
See below for details on running these to test your PnMPI installation.


A6) Environment setup
-----------------------
You will need to set one environment variable to run PnMPI:

PNMPI_LIB_PATH should be set to the full path to the lib/pnmpi-modules
directory in your PnMPI installation directory.  This enables the
runtime to find its modules.

Additionally, if you wish to build external modules, you should
set the PnMPI_DIR environment variable to the full path to your
PnMPI installation (that is, your CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX) so that
external module builds can find PnMPI configuration files.  See
Section (C) for more information on building custom modules.


A7) RPATH settings
-----------------------
By default, the build adds the paths of all dependency libraries
to the rpath of the installed PnMPI library.  This is the preferred
behavior on LLNL systems, where many packages are installed and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH usage can become confusing.

If you are installing on a system where you do NOT want dependent
libraries added to your RPATH, e.g. if you expect all of PnMPI's
dependencies to be found in system paths, then you can build without
rpath additions using this option to cmake:

  -D CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH=FALSE

This will add only the PnMPI installation lib directory to the
rpath of the PnMPI library.


A8) Adding ADEPT Timing Option
------------------------------
PnMPI can optionally profile itself and record internal timing
information. This includes measurements on how frequently
particular wrappers have been invoked and how long they took.

To enable this option, PnMPI must be configured with additional
timing routines, which are part of the adept_utils package.
The package is currently LLNL-internal, but can be distributed
on request.

If adept utils is installed in a standard system location, CMake
will autodetect it.  If they are in a custom location, you will
need to set the adept_utils_DIR environment variable to the prefix
under which adept_utils was installed, e.g.:

  setenv adept_utils_DIR /opt/my-custom-adept_utils

This will allow CMake to autodetect the build.  On LC machines,
you can just use adept_utils via the dotkit:

  use adept_utils

Once PnMPI is compiled with adept_utils, the additional timing
statistics can be enabled dynamically (see Section E).


B) Modules
==========

PnMPI supports two different kind of tool modules:
- Transparent modules
- PnMPI-specific modules

Among the former are modules that have been created independently of
PnMPI and are just based on the PMPI interface. To use a transparent
module in PnMPI the user has to perform two steps:
 1. Build the tool as a shared module (a dlopen-able shared library)
 2. Patch the tool using the 'pnmpi-patch' utility, which is incldued
    with the PnMPI distribution.

Usage:
  pnmpi-patch <original tool (in)> <patched tool (out)>
e.g.:
  pnmpi-patch my-module.so my-pnmpi-module.so

After that, copy the tool in the $PNMPI_LIB_PATH directory so that
PnMPI can pick it up.  Note that all of this is handled automatically
by the CMake build files included with PnMPI.

The second option is the use of PnMPI specific modules: these modules
also rely on the PMPI interface, but explicitly use some of the PnMPI
features (i.e., they won't run outside of PnMPI).  These modules
include the "pnmpimod.h" header file. This file also describes the
interface that modules can use. In short, the interface offers an
ability to register a module and after that use a publish/subscribe
interface to offer/use services in other modules. Note: also PnMPI
specific modules have to be patched using the utility described above.

This package includes a set of modules that can be used both
to create other tools using their services and as templates
for new modules.

The source for all modules is stored in separate directories
inside the "module" directory. There are:

sample:   a set of example modules that show how to wrap send and
          receive operations. These modules are used in the demo
          codes described below.

empty:    a transparent module that simply wraps all calls without
          executing any code. This can be used to test overhead
          or as a sample for new modules.

status:   This PnMPI specific module offers a service to add
          extra data to each status object to store additional
          information.

requests: This PnMPI specific module offers a service to track
          asynchronous communication requests. It relies on the
          status module.

datatype: This PnMPI specific module tracks all datatype
          creations and provides an iterator to walk any datatype.

comm:     This PnMPI specific module abstracts all communication in
          a few simple callback routines. It can be used to write
          quick prototype tools that intercept all communication
          operations independent of the originating MPI call.
          This infrastructure can be used by creating submodules: two
          such submodules are included: an empty one that can be used
          as a template and one that prints every message.
          Note: this module relies on the status, requests, and
          datatype modules. A more detailed description on how to
          implemented submodules is included in the comm directory
          as a separate README.

Note: All modules should be compiled with mpicc or equivalent
(which includes the MPI header files) and should be linked
without linking to the MPI library (to avoid MPI routines
being linked to multiple times).


C) Building your own modules with CMake
=======================================
PnMPI installs CMake build files with its distribution to allow
external projects to quickly build MPI tool modules.  The build
files allow external tools to use PnMPI, the pnmpi-patch utility,
PnMPI's wrapper generator, and PnMPI's dependency libraries.

To create a new PnMPI module, simply create a new project that looks
something like this:

my-project/
  CMakeLists.txt
  foo.c
  wrapper.w

Assume that wrapper.w is a wrapper generator input file that will
generate another file called wrapper.c, which contains MPI interceptor
functions for the tool library.  foo.c is additional code needed for
the tool library.  CMakeLists.txt is the CMake build file.  Before
you build, you will need to set the PnMPI_DIR environment variable:

    setenv PnMPI_DIR /path/to/pnmpi/installation

Unless you have installed PnMPI in a standard system location (/usr,
/usr/local, etc.), in which case it will be discoveredautomatically.

Your CMakeLists.txt file should start start with something like this:

  project(my-module C)
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)

  find_package(PnMPI REQUIRED)
  find_package(MPI REQUIRED)

  add_wrapped_file(wrapper.c wrapper.w)
  add_pnmpi_module(foo foo.c wrapper.c)

  install(TARGETS foo DESTINATION ${PnMPI_MODULES_DIR})

  include_directories(
    ${MPI_INCLUDE_PATH}
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})

project() and cmake_minimum_required() are standard.  These tell the build
the name of the project and what version of CMake it will need.

find_package(PnMPI) will try to find PnMPI in system locations, and if
it is not found, it will fail because the REQUIRED option has been specified.

find_package(MPI) locates the system MPI installation so that you can use its
variables in the CMakeLists.txt file.

add_wrapped_file() tells the build that wrapper.c is generated from wrapper.w,
and it adds rules and dependenciesto the build to automatically run the wrapper
generator when wrapper.c is needed.

Finally, add_pnmpi_module() function's much like CMake's builtin add_library()
command, but it ensures that the PnMPI library is built as a loadable module
and that the library is properly patched.

install() functions just as it does in a standard CMake build, but here we
install to the PnMPI_MODULES_DIR instead of an install-relative location.
This variable is set if PnMPI is found by find_package(PnMPI), and it allows
users to install directly into the system PnMPI installation.

Finally, include_directories() functions as it would in a normal CMake build.

Once you've make your CMakeLists.txt file like this, you can build your
PnMPI module like so:

  cd my-module
  mkdir $SYS_TYPE && cd $SYS_TYPE
  cmake ..
  make -j8
  make -j8 install

This should find PnMPI on your system and build your module, assuming that
you have your environment set up correctly.

D) Debug Options
================
The debug build of PnMPI includes debug print options, that can
be dynamically enabled. To control it, the environment variable
DBGLEVEL can be set to any combination of the following flags:

0x01 - Trace all entry and exit points for PnMPI
0x02 - Additional information for module load and instantiation
0x04 - Trace all entry and exit points for all modules
0x08 - Debug information for parsing and module arguments
0x10 - Collect and print statistics about module invocations
0x20 - Collect and print statistics about module timings
(only available if compiled with adept_utils - see Section C4)

Additionally, the printouts can be restricted to a single
node (except for the 0x10 and 0x20, which always only print
on node 0) by setting the variable DBGNODE to an MPI rank.


E) Configuration and Demo codes
===============================

The PnMPI distribution includes two demo codes (in C and F77).
They can be used to experiment with the basic PnMPI functionalities
and to test the system setup. The following describes the
C version (the F77 version works similarly):

- change into the "demo" directory
- The program "simple.c", which sends a message from any task with
  ID>0 to task 0, was compiled into three binaries:
    - simple    (plain MPI code)
    - simple-pn (linked with PnMPI)
    - simple-s1 (plain code linked with sample1.so)

- executing simple will run as usual
  The program output (for 2 nodes) will be:
GOT 1
- by relinking the code, one can use any of the
  original (unpatched) modules with this codes.
  The unpatched modules are in modules/sample
  Examples: simplest-s1 linked with sample1

- PnMPI is configured through a configuration file that lists all modules
  to be load by PnMPI as well as optional arguments. The name for this
  file can be specified by the environment variable "PNMPI_CONF". If this
  variable is not set or the file specified can not be found, PnMPI looks
  for a file called ".pnmpi_conf" in the current working directory, and
  if not found, in the user's home directory.

  By default the file in the demo directory is named ".pnmpi_conf" and
  looks as follows:

module sample1
module sample2
module sample3
module sample4

  (plus some additional lines starting with #, which indicates comments)

  This configuration causes these four modules to be loaded
  in the specified order. PnMPI will look for the corresponding
  modules ( .so shared library files) in $PNMPI_LIB_PATH.

- Running simple-pn will load all four modules in the specified
  order and intercept all MPI calls included in these modules:
    - sample1: send and receive
    - sample2: send
    - sample3: receive
    - sample4: send and receive
  The program output (for 2 nodes) will be:

    0:
    0:            ---------------------------
    0:           | P^N-MPI Interface         |
    0:           | Martin Schulz, 2005, LLNL |

WRAPPER 2: After send
WRAPPER 1: After send
WRAPPER 1: Before recv

WRAPPER 1: Before send
WRAPPER 2: Before send
WRAPPER 4: Before send

WRAPPER 2: After send
WRAPPER 1: After send
GOT 1
WRAPPER 4: Before recv
WRAPPER 4: After recv
WRAPPER 3: After recv
WRAPPER 1: After recv

When running on a BG/P systems, it is necessary to explicitly export
some environment variables. Here is an example:

mpirun -np 4 -exp_env LD_LIBRARY_PATH -exp_env PNMPI_LIB_PATH -cwd $PWD simple-pn


F) Using of MPI_Pcontrol
========================
The MPI standard defines the MPI_Pcontrol, which does not have any
direct effect (it is implemented as a dummy call inside of MPI), but
that can be replaced by PMPI to accepts additional information from
MPI applications (e.g., turn on/off data collection or markers for
main iterations). The information is used by a PMPI tool linked to
the application. When it is used with PnMPI the user must therefore
decide which tool an MPI_Pcontrol call is directed to.

By default PnMPI will direct Pcontrol calls to first module in the
tool stack only. If this is not the desired effect, users can turn
on and off which module Pcontrols reach by adding "pcontrol on" and
"pcontrol off" into the configuration file in a separate line
following the corresponding module specification. Note that PnMPI
allows that Pcontrol calls are sent to multiple modules.

In addition, the general behavior of Pcontrols can be specified
with a global option at the beginning of the configuration file.
This option is called "globalpcontrol" and can take one of the
following arguments:

	int	only deliver the first argument, but ignore
	        the variable list arguments (default)
	pmpi	forward the variable list arguments
	pnmpi	requires the application to specify a specific
	        format in the variable argument list known to
	        PnMPI (level must be PNMPI_PCONTROL_LEVEL)
	mixed   same as pnmpi, if level==PNMPI_PCONTROL_LEVEL
                same as pmpi,  if level!=PNMPI_PCONTROL_LEVEL
	typed  	<tlevel> <type>
		forward the first argument in any case, the
 		second only if the level matches <tlevel>. In
		this case, assume that the second argument is
		of type <type>

The PnMPI internal format for Pcontrol arguments is as follows:

	int level (same semantics as for MPI_Pcontrol itself)
	int type = PNMPI_PCONTROL_SINGLE or PNMPI_PCONTROL_MULTIPLE
                   (target one or more modules) |
                   PNMPI_PCONTROL_VARG or PNMPI_PCONTROL_PTR
                   (arguments as vargs or one pointer)
	int mod = target module (if SINGLE)
	int modnum = number of modules (if MULTIPLE)
	int *mods = pointer to array of modules
	int size = length of all variable arguments (if VARG)
	void *buf = pointer to argument block (if PTR)

Known issues:

Forwarding the variable argument list as done in pmpi and mixed is only
implemented in a highly experimental version and disabled by default.
To enable, compile PnMPI with the flag EXPERIMENTAL_UNWIND and link
PnMPI with the libunwind library. Note that this is not extensively
tested and not portable across platforms.
