# Doxyfile 1.8.11
#
# This file contains all non-default values for the doxygen configuration. The
# documentation of all configuration entries is taken from the doxygen skeleton
# configuration file.


# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.
PROJECT_NAME = "@PROJECT_NAME@"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.
PROJECT_NUMBER = "@PNMPI_VERSION@"

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
# part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to
# strip.
#
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which
# will be relative from the directory where doxygen is started. This tag
# requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.
STRIP_FROM_PATH = @PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR@

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen
# uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.
# Minimum value: 1, maximum value: 16, default value: 4.
TAB_SIZE = 2

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. For
# instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list of all
# members will be omitted, etc.
# The default value is: NO.
OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C = YES

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.
EXTRACT_ALL = YES

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be
# included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.
EXTRACT_STATIC = @DOXYGEN_EXTRACT_STATIC@

# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated to
# standard output by doxygen. If QUIET is set to YES this implies that the
# messages are off.
# The default value is: NO.
QUIET = YES

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.
INPUT = @PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR@/src     \
        @PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR@/modules \
        @PROJECT_BINARY_DIR@/pnmpi-config.h

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.
RECURSIVE = YES

# The EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS tag can be used to specify one or more symbol names
# (namespaces, classes, functions, etc.) that should be excluded from the
# output. The symbol name can be a fully qualified name, a word, or if the
# wildcard * is used, a substring. Examples: ANamespace, AClass,
# AClass::ANamespace, ANamespace::*Test
#
# Note that the wildcards are matched against the file with absolute path, so to
# exclude all test directories use the pattern */test/*
EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS = _GNU_SOURCE main __pad*__ args

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a personal HTML footer for
# each generated HTML page. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a
# standard footer.
HTML_FOOTER = "@PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR@/doc/footer.html"

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.
GENERATE_LATEX = NO

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
# defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.
PREDEFINED = PNMPI_ENABLE_THREAD_SAFETY \
             COMPILE_FOR_FORTRAN        \
             DBGLEVEL

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# http://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is
# set to NO
# The default value is: NO.
HAVE_DOT = @DOXYGEN_DOT_FOUND@

# If the CALL_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a call
# dependency graph for every global function or class method.
#
# Note that enabling this option will significantly increase the time of a run.
# So in most cases it will be better to enable call graphs for selected
# functions only using the \callgraph command. Disabling a call graph can be
# accomplished by means of the command \hidecallgraph.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.
CALL_GRAPH = YES

# If the CALLER_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a caller
# dependency graph for every global function or class method.
#
# Note that enabling this option will significantly increase the time of a run.
# So in most cases it will be better to enable caller graphs for selected
# functions only using the \callergraph command. Disabling a caller graph can be
# accomplished by means of the command \hidecallergraph.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.
CALLER_GRAPH = YES

# The DOT_PATH tag can be used to specify the path where the dot tool can be
# found. If left blank, it is assumed the dot tool can be found in the path.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.
DOT_PATH = @DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE@
